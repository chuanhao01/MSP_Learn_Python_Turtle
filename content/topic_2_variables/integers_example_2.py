# Variables can be integers as well
a = 1
b = 2

# Addition
# "+" operator for integers mean addition
print(a + b)

# Subtraction
print(a - b)

# Multiplication
print(a * b)

# Division
print(a / b)

# The math operators can be use with assignment operator as well
# Same as before, taking the sum of current value of a with b, and assigning that sum to a
a = a + b 
print(a) # Should output 3 in the console
